# Introduction of Data Structures

### 1) Physical Data Structures:

- Arrays:
  Fixed size (Static),
  Arrays can be created in stack or heap,

- LinkedLists
  Variable size (Dynamic),
  LinkedLists can only be created in a heap,
  Head pointers are in a stack.

### 2) Logical Data Structures:

These Data Structures are implemented using Arrays or LinkedLists.

Linear DS:

- Stack: Last in First Out
- Queues: First in First Out

Non Linear DS:

- Trees
- Graph

Modular:

- HashTable
