# Recursion

#### What is Recursion?

- If a function is calling itself, it is called a recursive function.

- There has to be a base condition that terminates recursion.

        Type fun(param){
            if(<base condition>)
            {
                1. ___
                2. fun(param);
                3. ___
            }
        }
