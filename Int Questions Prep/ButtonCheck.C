/*
Write a C function to detect if a button is pressed or not. The button must be pressed/unpressed for 5 consecutive "checks" before the value reverts. 
In other words, the function starts with the button being unpressed. Every "check" happens in 10ms intervals. With each "check", the button will either 
be pressed or unpressed. You must wait for 5 "checks" (50ms) of continuous pressed/unpressed status updates before you update the output.
